## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### **"Node.js not found" Error**
- **Problem**: Node.js not installed or not in system PATH
- **Solution**: Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Verify**: Run `node --version` in command prompt

#### **"npm install" Fails**
- **Problem**: Network issues or permission errors
- **Solutions**:
  ```bash
  # Clear npm cache
  npm cache clean --force
  
  # Use different registry
  npm install --registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
  
  # Run as administrator (Windows)
  ```

#### **Application Won't Start**
- **Problem**: Missing dependencies or build issues
- **Solutions**:
  ```bash
  # Reinstall dependencies
  rm -rf node_modules
  npm install
  
  # Rebuild native modules
  npm run build
  ```

#### **"Invalid or missing file path" During Decryption**
- **Problem**: File path validation issues with uploaded files
- **Solution**: Use "Browse Directory" instead of drag & drop, or reselect file when prompted

#### **Files Not Appearing in Directory Scan**
- **Problem**: Permission issues or incorrect file extensions
- **Solutions**:
  - Ensure files have `.enc` extension
  - Check read permissions for selected directory
  - Try scanning a different directory

#### **Encryption/Decryption Fails**
- **Problem**: Disk space, permissions, or corrupted files
- **Solutions**:
  - Check available disk space
  - Verify file isn't currently open in another program
  - Try different output location
  - Check file integrity

### Debug Mode
Enable verbose logging:
```bash
# Development mode with debug output
npm run dev

# Check console for detailed error messages
# Look for red error text in terminal
```

### Performance Optimization
- **Large Files**: Encryption/decryption is streaming-based for memory efficiency
- **Directory Scanning**: Progress updates prevent UI freezing
- **UI Responsiveness**: Background processing with IPC communication

## üì¶ Building for Distribution

### Windows Distribution
```bash
# Interactive build menu
build.bat

# Command line options
npm run make-win        # Creates installer
npm run package         # Creates app folder
```

### Cross-Platform Building
```bash
# Requires appropriate OS or virtualization
npm run make-linux      # .deb, .rpm, .zip
npm run make-mac        # .dmg, .zip
```

### Distribution Files
- **Windows**: `File-Encryptor-Setup.exe` (installer)
- **Portable**: `File-Encryptor-Portable.zip`
- **Linux**: `.deb` and `.rpm` packages
- **macOS**: `.dmg` disk image

## üîí Security Considerations

### Password Security
- **Use strong passwords** (12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- **Never reuse passwords** from other accounts
- **Consider password managers** for generation and storage
- **Remember**: Lost passwords = lost files (no recovery possible)

### File Handling Best Practices
- **Test decryption** immediately after encryption
- **Backup important files** before encryption
- **Use "Erase Traces"** for sensitive data
- **Store encrypted files** in secure locations

### System Security
- **Keep system updated** for latest security patches
- **Use antivirus software** (app may trigger false positives)
- **Secure your computer** with login passwords
- **Regular backups** of encrypted files
