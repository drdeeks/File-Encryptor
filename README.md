- **Tauri CLI**: `npm install -g @tauri-apps/cli`

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/drdeeks/File-Encryptor.git
   cd File-Encryptor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run in development mode**
   ```bash
   npm run tauri:dev
   ```

### Building for Production

1. **Build the application**
   ```bash
   npm run tauri:build
   ```

2. **Find the executable**
   - **Windows**: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/msi/`
   - **macOS**: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/`
   - **Linux**: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/appimage/`

## üîß Usage

### Encrypting Files
1. **Select a file** using drag & drop or the file picker
2. **Enter a strong password** (minimum 8 characters)
3. **Choose an action** for the original file:
   - Keep Original: Preserve the original file
   - Delete Original: Remove the original file
   - Erase Traces: Overwrite with random data before deletion
4. **Click "Encrypt File"** and enjoy the dark humor

### Decrypting Files
1. **Select an encrypted file** (.enc extension)
2. **Enter the password** (hope you remember it!)
3. **Click "Decrypt File"** to restore your data

### Managing Files
1. **Choose a directory** to scan for encrypted files
2. **Browse and search** through your encrypted files
3. **Sort by name, date, or size** for easy organization
4. **Quick actions**: Decrypt, show in folder, or delete files

## üîí Security Features

### Cryptographic Implementation
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)
- **Key Derivation**: Argon2id with 100,000 iterations
- **Memory Cost**: 64MB for memory-hard operations
- **Salt Length**: 32 bytes of cryptographically secure random data
- **Nonce**: 12 bytes for AES-GCM
- **Authentication Tag**: 16 bytes for integrity verification

### Security Best Practices
- **Zeroization**: Sensitive data is securely cleared from memory
- **Constant-time Operations**: Protection against timing attacks
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all inputs
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak information
- **File Permissions**: Proper handling of file system permissions

### File Format
```
[8 bytes]  Magic Header: "FE2.0\0\0\0"
[1024 bytes] Metadata (JSON with padding)
[N bytes]  Encrypted Data
```

## üö® Security Considerations

### Password Security
- **Use strong passwords**: Minimum 8 characters, longer is better
- **Don't reuse passwords**: Each file should have a unique password
- **Store passwords securely**: Consider using a password manager
- **Backup passwords**: Losing the password means losing the data forever

### File Security
- **Backup important files**: Always keep backups of critical data
- **Test decryption**: Verify you can decrypt files after encryption
- **Secure storage**: Store encrypted files in secure locations
- **Regular updates**: Keep the application updated for security patches

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"File not found" error**
- Ensure the file path is correct and accessible
- Check file permissions on your system

**"Invalid password" error**
- Double-check the password spelling and case
- Ensure you're using the correct password for the file

**"Permission denied" error**
- Run the application with appropriate permissions
- Check if the file is being used by another application

**"Disk space insufficient" error**
- Ensure you have enough free disk space
- Encrypted files may be larger than the original

### Performance Tips
- **Large files**: The application can handle files up to several GB
- **Batch operations**: Use the file manager for multiple files
- **Compression**: Enable compression for better storage efficiency
- **Memory usage**: Close other applications for very large files
