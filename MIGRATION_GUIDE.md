- Application settings (if any)

### Step 2: Uninstall v1.0 (Optional)
You can keep both versions installed, but it's recommended to uninstall v1.0:

**Windows:**
```cmd
# Remove from Programs and Features
# Or run the uninstaller if available
```

**macOS:**
```bash
# Drag the app to Trash
# Or use: sudo rm -rf /Applications/File\ Encryptor.app
```

**Linux:**
```bash
# Remove package if installed via package manager
sudo apt remove file-encryptor  # Ubuntu/Debian
sudo dnf remove file-encryptor  # Fedora
```

### Step 3: Install v2.0
Download and install the new version from the releases page.

### Step 4: Test Compatibility
1. **Test Decryption**: Try decrypting a few files from v1.0
2. **Verify Integrity**: Ensure decrypted files are identical to originals
3. **Check Performance**: Notice the improved speed and responsiveness

## üîê File Format Changes

### v1.0 Format (Legacy)
